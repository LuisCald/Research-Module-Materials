# Pro-environmental Behavior and Generalized Trust: A Mediation Analysis

This repository contains the code and PDF documentation for the research paper titled **"Pro-environmental Behavior and Generalized Trust: A Mediation Analysis"** by Luis Calderon and Madina Japakhova.

## Paper Summary

This study extends the literature on the relationship between generalized trust and pro-environmental behavior (PEB) by addressing endogeneity issues commonly overlooked in previous research. Using data from the European Social Survey (ESS8), the paper examines how generalized trust influences PEB, mediated through four channels: religion, family, democracy, and political ideology.

Key findings include:
- Generalized trust significantly impacts pro-environmental behavior, even after controlling for multiple confounds.
- The mediating effect of trust is particularly robust through the channel of religion.
- The analysis highlights the need for future research to address causal relationships using more robust methodologies, such as instrumental variable analysis or structural equation modeling.

While the study does not establish causality, it provides a foundation for understanding the role of trust in promoting sustainable behaviors.
